# Maximum Versatility.

An extremely flextible dish that, despite its north african heritage, can be made to taste like almost anything, with a high protein low calorie variant for the gymbros. Indian, korean, middle eastern, or italian, you can make it taste different every time. **make sure to read the variations section for various improvements on the base recipe.**


# Cost and Nutrition per serving

- Cost: 25 INR
- Calories: 280 - 500 [depending on recipe variant]
- Protein: 20-27g


# Ingredients

- 4-6 Eggs
- Tomatoes, ~500g fresh or 1 box (**Recommended: Dabur tomato puree tetra pack**)
- 2-3 Medium Onions
- 5-10 cloves garlic, equivalent amount ginger
- 2-3 green chillies
- Butter
- Spices: 
    - Chilli powder - 3/4 tbsp
    - Coriander powder - 3/4 tbsp
    - Turmeric powder - 1/2 tsp
    - Garam masala - 1 tsp or to taste
    - Cumin powder (optional) - 1/2 tbsp
- Sugar/Honey
- Fresh herb of your choice (coriander, spring onion, dill, whatever)
- coriander stems
- low moisture mozzarella cheese (optional but highly recommended)

# Prep

- Finely dice your onions first, put em in the pan with some butter on medium heat, then do the rest of the prep
- Dice tomatoes, Mix spices except for garam masala and keep aside, get everything in place

# Recipe (desi variant)

- Pan on medium heat, Saute onions in butter until browned
- add all spices except for garam masala, tomato paste (if using fresh tomatoes), stir for ~1 minute
- Pan on high heat, Add ginger,garlic,green chillies and coriander stems and saute for 30-40 seconds
- Add tomatoes/puree and stir. Add sugar/honey to balance out the sourness of the tomato. Pan on medium-low, simmer for 3-4 minutes if boxed, and 15-20 minutes if fresh.
- finish with garam masala, fresh herbs, and optionally butter/cream, and give it a good stir. salt to taste.
- Crack in 4-6 eggs depending on pan size, from a height of 20-25 cm so that it forms its own little bowl of sauce where it falls.
- Sprinkle salt and pepper on top, then cover with the lid. 
- Pan on medium heat for 60-70 seconds, then on the lowest possible heat for 3-6 minutes until the egg whites have the texture of custard and the yolks are jammy and runny.
- Finish with fresh herbs and lime juice, optionally top with 20g of cheese per serving. 
- serve on white rice, bread, or roti.


# Variations and techniques

## Sufi's Recommendations
 
I like to finish my tomato sauce with 

- 1 tbsp of good quality soy sauce 
- a small splash of fish sauce
- some heavy cream
- 1 clove very finely minced fresh garlic, and 
- Japanese mirin (can be substituted with sugar or honey)

I find that these additions do a LOT to increase the umami and flavour of the dish, while still keeping the desi taste. Finely minced garlic 
at the end of the dish is something i do in a lot of dishes, as garlic tastes very mild in the sauce because of how hard it's cooked and I like 
introducing some of the sharp garlic taste back. Very little effort for a big flavour boost.

**Make sure to use decent quality soy sauce, kikkoman or yamamori.** 
They cost around 240 for half a litre and taste like a *completely different ingredient* when compared to the hydrolysed soy protein crap you 
get in the rest of the market. The ching's stuff is a crime against humanity. 

## High protein, Low calorie: +10 rupees, +7g protein, -100 calories.

- Reduce how much butter or fat you use in the recipe
- Add 20g low moisture mozzarella/serve.
- Reduce the portion of rice, increase the portion of shakshouka
- That's it! This recipe is already very low calorie and high protein, but some minor additions can make it even better in that aspect. 

## Korean flavours

**Sweet, spicy, and umami** is the name of the game here. Gochujang does a lot of the heavy lifting in this version of the dish. 

- Replace spices with 
    - gochugaru/chilli flakes
    - extra minced ginger
    - gochujang paste
    - soy sauce
    - fish sauce
    - rice vinegar (can use white)
- Replace butter with sesame oil
- Use brown sugar wherever needed
- Use spring onions instead of cilantro
- Make sure to go hard on the spice.

## Italian flavours

A simpler variation that relies on **simple, fresh flavours, quality ingredients, and good technique**. Bland and boring if done poorly, but one of my favourite variations when executed well.

- Instead of what's basically a tomato curry, make a simple marinara sauce with just onion, garlic, butter/olive oil, and black pepper. Optionally bay leaves.
- Simmer fresh basil in the tomato sauce for 4-5 minutes before adding eggs
- Top with fresh torn basil and parmesan, grana padano, or any other hard, dry, and flavourful cheese.

## Middle Eastern flavours

I make this whenever i have labneh (curd drained of all the whey and water, kind of like cream cheese) in the fridge. Zataar and labneh go super well with this dish.

- Olive oil for the fat. butter is acceptable.
- no ginger, only garlic
- add diced capsicum with the onions
- Replace spices with
    - Cumin powder
    - chilli flakes
    - black pepper
    - sumac (if you have it)
- at the end, top with cilantro/dill, dollops of labneh, and liberally sprinkle zataar over the dish.
- feta cheese also works, but labneh is a lot cheaper to make.
