# The blog is real!

I've been wanting to make a little repository to post my recipes, nerdposts, and whatever else for a while now. I like cooking, a lot, and I spend a lot of time finding recipes, and then making them again and again until
i'm happy with them, because i'm an annoying perfectionist when it comes to food.

A lot of online recipes are **impractical**, **expensive**, or aimed more at getting views than being something you can add to your rotation. On top of that, the decent recipes you DO get are often US-centric and use ingredients that are
difficult in India. There's a lot of great indian content creators, but there isn't that much stuff aimed at your **average bachelor**. 


Thus, my niche reveals itself: **if you're a college student or prefessional who wants recipes that can be made in large batches, costing below 50-60 rupees per plate, made with ingredients easily accessible to the average indian, i'm your girl.**
